            technologies on challenging and diverse projects.

            I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
            improving my chops one design problem at a time.

            If I need to define myself in one sentence that would be a family
            person, father of a beautiful daughter, a sports fanatic,
            photography enthusiast, and tech-obsessed!!!

            Short Story how i got to germany: There are changes in life that can open up for you new
            unexplored paths. The only question is, do you dare to follow one of
            them? In 2009 my father sent me on a special secret mission to
            Germany. I was told that this was a secret mission for the benefit
            of our country. My mission was to study and find a job. Now I
            realized that this was not a mission, just my parents wanted my room
            to make a yoga hall out of it.
